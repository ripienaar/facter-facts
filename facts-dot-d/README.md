What?
=====

A simple little framework to get facts from external sources.

You can create files in /etc/facts.d which can be text, yaml,
json or executables.  In the case of executables it supports
caching so you only need to run your expensive scripts every
now and then.

NOTE: This feature has been rewritten and incorporated into
Facter 1.7.0, you should use that instead.  This code is now
dead and removed.
